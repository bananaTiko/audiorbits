## A web wallpaper designed for [Wallpaper Engine](https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960)

## [THIS](https://github.com/hexxone/audiorbits) is the wallpaper's public git repository.

## NOTICE

The Wallpaper is made for and maintained on the **Steam Workshop**.
It is however basically a website and can be easily run in most browsers.

Since you usually need to own Wallpaper Engine in order to access it's Workshop Content (this Wallpaper), I published this repository...

*But:* **Please address any issues or suggestions on on Steam.**

Also, feel free to use this Wallpaper at your favourite party, event, video, stream, etc.

Please just remember to include a link to the Steam-Page or THIS repository - Thanks :)
