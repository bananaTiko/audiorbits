## A web wallpaper designed for [Wallpaper Engine](https://steamcommunity.com/app/431960)

## [THIS](https://github.com/hexxone/audiorbits) is the wallpaper's public git repository.

## NOTICE

The Wallpaper is made for and maintained on the **Steam Workshop**.
It is however basically a website and can be easily run in *most* browsers.

Usually you need to own Wallpaper Engine in order to access it's Workshop Content (this Wallpaper).
And so, in order to fullfill the Licenses on this Software, I published this repository.

*But:* **Please address any [Issues](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1396475780/1744478429683052516/) or [Ideas](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1396475780/1744478429683052516/) on on Steam.**
